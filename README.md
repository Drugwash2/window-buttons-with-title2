# window-buttons-with-title2@hanspr
Applet for Cinnamon desktop, shows current window's title, icon and/or buttons in panel

This is a quick fix of the original applet, provided for compatibility with Cinnamon newer than 5.4.

if you simply download the code and not the prepackaged zip archive,
the folder name will have to be changed to window-buttons-with-title2@hanspr ,
otherwise the applet will not load or work properly or at all.

Applets are usually placed in ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets.
